# sflr_bot

This is a small project I made for self-learning.

## What's inside
- `jh.py`: the main code for my Telegram bot
- `.gitignore`: tells Git which files to skip (like `.env`, `info.py`, `shopcart.db`, and other stuff I don’t want online)

## How to run
1. Install the required packages
2. Run `jh.py` and see it work

## Notes
- The `.env` file has private info (like keys/passwords), so it’s not on GitHub. You’ll need to create your own if you want to run the bot.
